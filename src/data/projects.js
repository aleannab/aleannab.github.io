    description: "An “Immersive Memory” experience, Emerging Radiance celebrates the untold stories of Japanese American farmers who were taken from their homes and unjustly incarcerated during WWII. In partnership with Creative Director Tani Ikeda and Muralist Michelle Kumata, Invisible Thread harnessed Augmented Reality’s unrivaled ability to tell location-based stories by weaving together art, animation, archival audio recordings, and immersive technology to create a collection of far-reaching experiences that ultimately continue to give voice to the stories of our past for the generations of tomorrow.\n\nI was part of Invisible Thread’s technical artist team that brought this creative vision to reality in Spark AR.\n\nEmerging Radiance won the Tribeca X Award for Best Immersive Experience and is currently being considered for a Peabody Award..",

    description: "A variety of themed “stickers” were commissioned by Meta. These kits were a collection of 2D and 3D augmented reality objects to be placed by the user in their current environment. This was a fast paced and highly collaborative project. I was part of Invisible Thread’s technical artist team that integrated 2D and 3D artist assets into Spark AR. I further brought the stickers to life by creating various physical simulations and procedural animations, as well as programming shaders.",

I was responsible for the base application framework, and the ambient and panel modes. I collaborated closely with the designer on the UX flows and motion. It was a very iterative process. This was made in C++ and OpenGL using our internal framework DSCinder.",
